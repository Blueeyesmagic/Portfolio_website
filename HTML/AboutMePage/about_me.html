        <p>I am a Student from Germany and about to get my Abitur. I am interessted in various things from
            sports to art to electronics. The stuff I am working on, in topics of informatic, you can see 
            in the Portfolio tab.

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>In my Portfolio you can see everything IÂ´ve ever done in termes of informatics. I begann coding
            in the middle of the quarantaine and back there I often tried programming different kinds of games.
            None of those "games", if you want to title them as those, made it to a point where you could release
            them.</p>
